if any company upload information on sebi website can we get realtime notification with summary after reading pdf files on whatapp directly
ChatGPT said:

Yes, you can build a system to get real-time notifications (with summaries of PDF disclosures) from the SEBI website directly to WhatsApp — but there are technical, legal, and practical considerations.

Let’s break it down clearly:

✅ What You Want Is Possible

Goal:
If a listed company uploads a document (PDF disclosure) to SEBI’s website, your system should:

Detect it in real time or near real-time

Download and read the PDF

Summarize it using AI

Send a WhatsApp message with the summary + link

🧠 Real-time Detection – How Feasible?

SEBI doesn't provide a push API or webhook for disclosures.

So you must "poll" the disclosures page regularly (e.g., every 1–5 minutes).

Polling is fast and can be efficient if done right (with caching, headers, smart diffing).

✅ Real-time in this case means "near real-time" — say, within 1–5 minutes.

📥 Step-by-Step Flow (Automated Pipeline)
1. Poll SEBI Disclosure Page

Scrape this page every few minutes:
📄 https://www.sebi.gov.in/sebiweb/home/HomeAction.do?doListingAll=yes

Extract latest disclosures, their titles, and PDF URLs

Keep a record of already-processed links

2. Download PDF

Use requests or PyMuPDF to download & extract content.

import fitz  # PyMuPDF

def extract_pdf_text(pdf_url):
    response = requests.get(pdf_url)
    with open("temp.pdf", "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)

    doc = fitz.open("temp.pdf")
    text = "\n".join([page.get_text() for page in doc])
    return text

3. Summarize PDF Text

Use an AI summarizer like OpenAI GPT or local models (for cheaper scale).

def summarize(text):
    prompt = f"Summarize this SEBI disclosure in 3 lines:\n\n{text[:3000]}"
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

4. Send WhatsApp Message

Use Twilio, 360dialog, or Meta WhatsApp Cloud API.

from twilio.rest import Client

def send_whatsapp_message(summary, link, to="+91XXXXXXXXXX"):
    client = Client("TWILIO_SID", "TWILIO_AUTH")
    message = client.messages.create(
        from_="whatsapp:+14155238886",
        to=f"whatsapp:{to}",
        body=f"📢 New SEBI Disclosure:\n\n{summary}\n\n📄 Full PDF: {link}"
    )
    return message.sid
